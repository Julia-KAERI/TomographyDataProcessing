	abstract = {Synchrotron-based X-ray micro-tomography systems often suffer severe ring artifacts in reconstructed images. In sinograms the artifacts appear as straight lines or stripe artifacts. These artifacts are caused by the irregular response of a detecting system giving rise to a variety of observed types of stripes: full stripes, partial stripes, fluctuating stripes, and unresponsive stripes. The use of pre-processing techniques such as distortion correction or phase retrieval blurs and enlarges these stripes. It is impossible for a single approach to remove all types of stripe artifacts. Here, we propose three techniques for tackling all of them. The proposed techniques are easy to implement; do not generate extra stripe artifacts and void-center artifacts; and give superior quality on challenging data sets and in comparison with other techniques. Implementations in Python and a challenging data set are available for download.},

	abstract = {A method of ring artefact suppression in X-ray computerised tomography (CT) reconstructions is proposed. The method is based on the assumption that a sinogram is a smooth function along the horizontal spatial coordinate. Methods based on the theory of ill-posed problems are applied to find a regularised solution. An analytical formula for the solution is proposed allowing fast ring artefact suppression. Its performance is demonstrated for parallel beam synchrotron X-ray tomography.},

	abstract = {A fast, powerful and stable filter based on combined wavelet and Fourier analysis for the elimination of horizontal or vertical stripes in images is presented and compared with other types of destriping filters. Strict separation between artifacts and original features allowing both, suppression of the unwanted structures and high degree of preservation of the original image information is endeavoured. The results are validated by visual assessments, as well as by quantitative estimation of the image energy loss. The capabilities and the performance of the filter are tested on a number of case studies related to applications in tomographic imaging. The case studies include (i) suppression of waterfall artifacts in electron microscopy images based on focussed ion beam nanotomography, (ii) removal of different types of ring artifacts in synchrotron based X-ray microtomography and (iii) suppression of horizontal stripe artifacts from phase projections in grating interferometry.},

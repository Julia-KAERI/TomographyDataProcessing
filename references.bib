@article{Vo2014,
	abstract = {High-throughput processing of parallel-beam X-ray tomography at synchrotron facilities is lacking a reliable and robust method to determine the center of rotation in an automated fashion, i.e. without the need for a human scorer. Well-known techniques based on center of mass calculation, image registration, or reconstruction evaluation work well under favourable conditions but they fail in cases where samples are larger than field of view, when the projections show low signal-to-noise, or when optical defects dominate the contrast. Here we propose an alternative technique which is based on the Fourier analysis of the sinogram. Our technique shows excellent performance particularly on challenging data.},

The method is based on the assumption that a sinogram is a smooth function along the horizontal spatial coordinate. Methods based on the theory of ill-posed problems are applied to find a regularised solution. An analytical formula for the solution is proposed allowing fast ring artefact suppression. Its performance is demonstrated for parallel beam synchrotron X-ray tomography.},

@article{Munch2009,
	abstract = {A fast, powerful and stable filter based on combined wavelet and Fourier analysis for the elimination of horizontal or vertical stripes in images is presented and compared with other types of destriping filters. Strict separation between artifacts and original features allowing both, suppression of the unwanted structures and high degree of preservation of the original image information is endeavoured. The results are validated by visual assessments, as well as by quantitative estimation of the image energy loss. The capabilities and the performance of the filter are tested on a number of case studies related to applications in tomographic imaging. The case studies include (i) suppression of waterfall artifacts in electron microscopy images based on focussed ion beam nanotomography, (ii) removal of different types of ring artifacts in synchrotron based X-ray microtomography and (iii) suppression of horizontal stripe artifacts from phase projections in grating interferometry.},

@article{Zitova2003,
	abstract = {This paper aims to present a review of recent as well as classic image registration methods. Image registration is the process of overlaying images (two or more) of the same scene taken at different times, from different viewpoints, and/or by different sensors. The registration geometrically align two images (the reference and sensed images). The reviewed approaches are classified according to their nature (area-based and feature-based) and according to four basic steps of image registration procedure: feature detection, feature matching, mapping function design, and image transformation and resampling. Main contributions, advantages, and drawbacks of the methods are mentioned in the paper. Problematic issues of image registration and outlook for the future research are discussed too. The major goal of the paper is to provide a comprehensive reference source for the researchers involved in image registration, regardless of particular application areas.},

@article{Donath2006,
	abstract = {Tomographic reconstruction requires precise knowledge of the position of the center of rotation in the sinogram data; otherwise, artifacts are introduced into the reconstruction. In parallel-beam microtomography, where resolution in the 1 $\mu$m range is reached, the center of rotation is often only known with insufficient accuracy. We present three image metrics for the scoring of tomographic reconstructions and an iterative procedure for the determination of the position of the optimum center of rotation. The metrics are applied to model systems as well as to microtomography data from a synchrotron radiation source. The center of rotation is determined using the image metrics and compared with the results obtained by the center-of-mass method and by image registration. It is found that the image metrics make it possible to determine the axis position reliably at well below the resolution of one detector bin in an automated procedure.},
